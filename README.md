# Prague Trip Guide (PDF)

A design-forward, practical city guide I created to support a large group trip to Prague. I produced this document alongside the full end-to-end organization of the trip, with the goal of giving participants one clear, reliable source for logistics, recommendations, and a suggested program.

## Context
This guide was created as part of my role as **Travel Lead** for the cultural association of my engineering school.  
I was responsible for organizing a **100-person trip to Prague** (planning, coordination, and execution). In addition to managing the operational side, I shared this guide with participants to improve the on-site experience and reduce friction (where to go, how to avoid common tourist traps, what to prioritize, and how to navigate the city efficiently).

## What's inside
The guide includes:
- Quick intro + context
- A "Prague Bingo" (group challenges)
- Practical do's & don'ts (money exchange, tourist traps, transport, etc.)
- Where to **eat** (local dishes + curated addresses)
- What to **see** (must-see landmarks + cultural spots)
- Where to go out (**bars/clubs**) + nightlife tips
- Prague by neighborhood (what to see / eat / drink per area)
- Useful Czech words & phrases
- A suggested day-by-day program / schedule

## File
- `Voyage_a_Prague_Guide.pdf` (recommended filename)  
  If your file is currently named with spaces/accents (e.g., `Voyage à Prague.pdf`), consider renaming it for portability.

## How to view
Open the PDF directly in GitHub, or download it locally and open it with any PDF reader.

## Why this is in my portfolio
This project demonstrates:
- **Ownership & delivery**: taking full responsibility for a complex, high-stakes project (100 participants)
- **Operational planning & coordination**: anticipating constraints, sequencing actions, and enabling smooth execution
- **Information architecture**: structuring a lot of information into a document people can actually use
- **User-centric communication**: making guidance actionable, skimmable, and memorable
- **Curation & prioritization**: selecting what matters, reducing noise, and improving decision-making on the ground

## Notes
Created in 2021. Some venues/prices may have changed since then, but the structure and approach (curation + planning + readability) is the core deliverable.
